# Methods

## AI Models and Tools
- **Cascading Failure Modeling**: Simulates interconnected risks, such as heatwaves impacting refrigeration.
- **Geospatial Clustering**: Identifies hotspots for violations.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Ensures transparency in risk prediction.

## Microsimulation
- Modeled heat-related illness and death.
- Evaluated the cost-effectiveness of interventions like cooling centers.
